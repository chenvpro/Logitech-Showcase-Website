This is a react frontend reponsive website. It's some of logitech keyboards showcase. So, navbar link can be clickable and are link to different pages. But, in the website footer, links are not clickable.
So, it's normal if you click and it go to a specific page.

There is a "useState" that is used on the navbar.jsx file and when the width is under a certain size the navbar change to a burger menu navigator.
